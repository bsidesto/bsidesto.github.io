						<p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>
						<p>Hak4Kidz is an event by ethical hackers and Information Security professionals dedicated to bring the educational and communal benefits of white hat hacking conferences to children and young adults. We accomplish this mission by putting our collective expertise and passion on display for the attendees to interact with us at their will. A combination of an open area of STEHM stations, and concentrated workshops will enable the attendees to expand and enlighten their technical interests.</p>

<p>For innovation to perpetuate, it is imperative that todayâ€™s young users are exposed to the bigger picture of how we got here and to help realize their potential.</p>

<p>Hak4Kidz will run from 9:30am - 4:30pm on October 5th. Check-in will start when bsidesTO check-in opens. Light lunch and snacks will be provided. Please bring a laptop for your child to use.</p>
