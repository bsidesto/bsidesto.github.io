						<p>
						Hak4Kidz is an event designed by ethical hackers and Information Security professionals, dedicated to bringing the educational and communal benefits of white hat hacking conferences to children and young adults, from 7-17 years of age. We accomplish our mission by putting our collective expertise and passion on display in activities that allow attendees to interact with a variety of technologies and skill sets. A combination of an open area of STEHM stations, and concentrated workshops will enable the attendees to expand and enlighten their technical interests.
