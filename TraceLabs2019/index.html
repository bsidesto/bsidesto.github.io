						<h2><a href="https://www.tracelabs.org/">Trace Labs</a> will be running a full day OSINT CTF for Missing Persons at BSides Toronto on October 5th, 2019!</h2>
					</header>
						<p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>
<p>Please note that registering for this event also gets you access to the BSidesTO and DarkSidesTO Briefings.</p>
<p>To participate in this Missing CTF, you must be attending BSidesTO in-person.</p>
<p>Trace Labs is a Not-For-Profit organization whose mission is to crowdsource the collection of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to generate new leads on active missing persons investigations.</p>
		<p>The missing persons issue is getting worse and requires modern and scalable solutions at various levels to help mitigate risk to society. Trace Labs leverages an intelligence platform that enables the of collection of OSINT to power these crowdsourced community CTF events. These CTF events allow missing persons to receive the attention that is needed early in the search process.</p>
		<p>For this CTF, contestants can participate as either a Solo Team or a team of up to 4.</p>
		<p>Contestants can pre-register on this Eventbrite or register onsite in the contest area.</p>
		<p><strong>Instructions for Forming a Team:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>When registering for this CTF, either join an existing team, or create a new team,</li>
			<li>When creating a new team, you will have to set a password on it, and provide that password to any individuals who want to join your team</li>
			<li>If joining an existing team, you will need to type in the team name in the "Join A Team" field on the register page and enter the password of that team</li>
			<li>One day prior to the CTF start, registered contestants will be e-mailed a registration link to be on boarded to the CTF platform</li>
		</ol>
		<P><strong>How does the CTF work?</strong></p>
		<p>For this CTF, 8 missing persons cases will be selected for contestants to collect OSINT on to generate new leads.</p>
		<p>This isn't a typical "Theoretical CTF" where the flags are already known. All flags found by contestants are treated as new intelligence that can serve as a potential lead for an active missing persons investigation.</p>
		<p>At the start of the event, contestants will be able to view the 8 missing persons case details by logging into the CTF platform at bsidesto.tracelabs.org with their own credentials (Registration e-mail to be sent one day prior to the CTF for those who have pre-registered).</p>
		<p>For each "OSINT Flag" submitted on one of the missing persons that falls into any of the categories listed here, the flag will be validated by one of our Judges prior to awarding points.</p>
		<p>Please also review our CTF rules here for first time contestants.</p>
		<p><strong>1st Place Prizes:</strong></p>
		<p>At the end of the CTF, the team with the most points on the scoreboard will claim first prize of:</p>
